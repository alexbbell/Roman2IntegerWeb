# Roman2IntegerWeb
Web part of Roman 2 integer converter


This app was made mostly for fun and to prove or disprove the fact that Net Core became cross-platform.
This scenario if my app was taken after one easy task in Leetcode (https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/808058862/). To tell the true, it's not very easy task if you start to check the entered data. It's easy only if the data is strongly correct. It simply converts Roman digits numbers to integer ones.

So I took an easy solution decided to make it a bit more difficult. 
This app is made with Net Core 5 application (web services) and React one. Two components. 
The host for this app is my small server with Debian, 1CPU and 2Gb DDR.
